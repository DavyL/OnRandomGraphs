Here we show that the same method applies to the analogous model of random k -uniform hypergraphs, establishing asymptotic normality throughout the (sparse) supercritical regime. Previously, asymptotic normality was known only towards the two ends of this regime. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct. Alg., 2012},

For a disconnected graph G, we use the convention that the diameter of G is the maximum diameter of its connected components. We show that almost surely the diameter of random graph G(n,p) is close to lognlog(np) if np→∞. Moreover if nplogn=c>8, then the diameter of G(n,p) is concentrated on two values. In general, if nplogn=c>c0, the diameter is concentrated on at most 2⌊1/c0⌋+4 values. We also proved that the diameter of G(n,p) is almost surely equal to the diameter of its giant component if np>3.6."

A categorical approach is used to formulate it. A new proof of Cayley's formula for the number of labelled trees is given as well as a new combinatorial proof (due to G. Labelle) of Lagrange's inversion formula. Polya's enumeration theory of isomorphism classes of structures is entirely renewed. Recursive methods for computing cycle index polynomials are described. A combinatorial version of the implicit function theorem is stated and proved. The paper ends with general considerations on the use of coalgebras in combinatorics."
